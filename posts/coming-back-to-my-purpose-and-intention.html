	<p class="quotes">
		My word of the year has been: Open.
	</p>
	<p>	
		Yet, I feel so much hesitancy in being genuine. <em>What if everyone judges me? What happens when everyone learns who I am? What if everyone leaves me? What if I end up alone, again? What if those thoughts in my head are true?</em> 
	</p>
	<p>
		When I started this blog, <a href="http://courtneyfaith.com/about.html">the intention</a> was to tap into my true-self and encourage personal growth and healing. It really wasn't for anyone else. I just needed a space to reveal and explore my path in a way that felt safe and authentic. So, this is it. It's time to unload and open up.
	</p>
	<p>
		Shit has been really hard. I wish I could say that recovery and the path to self-love are full of butterflies and radiant light. But, honestly, it's not. It hurts. It's incredibly painful looking at where you are and choosing to just be there. Sometimes the only thing I can do is look out the window and hold on. I hold on for just one more day.
	</p>
	<p class="dot">
		When we strip away the coping mechanisms: the walls, <a href="http://courtneyfaith.com/posts/my-path-to-eating-disorder-recovery.html">the eating disorders</a>, the addictions, the self-harm... We are giving ourselves permission to really feel the pain that has always been there. We are no longer cushioning or numbing the hurt. So, sometimes, it's unbearable.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is in these moments that I begin to truly feel compassion for my past. I can understand why I engaged in so many harmful behaviors and why the cravings to collapse back are so strong. The bravery it takes to be with that inner-child who is screaming, "Help me. Someone please help me," is simply beyond what I could write.	
	</p>
	<p>
		I want to be able to say that all is well, all is right, all is good. However, this is just not always the case. We are humans and we suffer. We feel and experience emotional pain and deserve to feel through that hurt if we need to.
	</p>
	<p class="dot">
		Sidenote: Occasionally, humans may try to convince you how you're feeling is invalid or wrong. But, please remember, you feel how you feel. I mean even Yoda says to trust your feelings- feelings are the way of the Force! So, in honor of Star Wars, I invite you to just throw up a middle finger and feel through that shit anyway. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We deserve to be <a href="http://courtneyfaith.com/posts/top-7-ways-to-cultivate-fulfilling-relationships.html">surrounded by people who love and support us</a> wherever we are on our path.
	</p>
	<p class="quotes">
		On the floor, panicking and reaching for something to save us? Deserving. Running through the streets, soaking in the bliss of abundance and life? Deserving. For as long as we are breathing, we deserve someone who will say, “You are so special, and I will love you until you can.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Right now, I am noticing a wave of deep gratitude. I am grateful to be loved. Even if I don’t feel it or accept it yet, I feel grateful to be surrounded by that energy always. Life loves me. Even if I have resistance, there's nothing I can do about it. Life will continue to love me anyway.
	</p> 
	<p>
		Needless to say, the defenses remain present. Just like everyone else, I crave acceptance. I want to feel whole. I want to feel belonging. But by going through this work and traveling my path, these defenses only expose so many sincere vulnerabilities. <a href="http://courtneyfaith.com/posts/7-considerations-before-changing-your-life.html">I have chosen to uncondintionally love myself</a>. Meaning, I have chosen to seep through and release this bullshit.
	</p>
	<p>	
		For now, I am not okay. I cannot always be okay. I cannot help others as much as I would like to yet. I am in need of personal healing. I need to care for little Courtney Faith who is so, deeply scared. 
	</p>
	<p>
		And... that's where I'm at today. I am withdrawing back into my inner-space. I am choosing to beam the healing energy back to me and get the love and support I need. 
	</p>
	<p class="quotes">
		Today, I am open. I am allowing all of life to see where I am and to know that there's power and purpose in every part of the journey.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are not alone, I am not alone, and unconditional love is our destiny.  
	</p>
