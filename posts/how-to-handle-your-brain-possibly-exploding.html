<!-- Collapsing onto a stained carpet, snatching your knees close to your heart, and whispering to yourself through wheezy snot breaths, “It’s okay. I’m okay. Everything’s okay.” is not what I would articulate as a preferred moment in time. That scrunched and shrinking human is having a difficult time being a human. 

So, when the entirety of your mind and body are enveloped in, what seems to be, an inescapable swamp of doom, what do you do?

It’s a pretty straightforward question. I mean, look at it -- it has four words. While Gogurts ® were becoming the shit, seven year old me was crushing sentences that would scoff at this. However, reality is not always as awesome as yogurt on the go. To escape the sweet hell of an emotional breakdown, “What do you do?” demands some serious, big-girl-panties attention. 

You are going to have to step-up and look back at your broken and terrified self. You are going to have to be the person you need. 

Through gentle and inquisitive self-reflection, healing answers do come. However, this is a process so get ready to practice your heart out. 

First: You can only know what to do by initially not knowing what to do.
I know you have heard this. I know it’s annoying to read things you already know. And believe me, I know that clichés are the worst. But please, resist the resistance and let this one wiggle in. Holding yourself to the unattainable expectation that “You can support yourself without having any prior knowledge on how to do so” is frankly, just not cool. Cool people don’t do things that aren’t cool… because it isn’t cool. And so, because you are an innately cool human, allow yourself to be where you are today and move on to step two. 

Second: Do something, literally anything.
Not to come across overly optimistic but, you will probably fail. This is not a remark on your character or your inevitable capacity for greatness. You are simply embarking on an untraveled path. (Thank you) The only way to step out of stagnation is to try something you have never done before. That’s it. Maybe that healthy coping mechanism works for you the first time around, stick with it and use that shit again. If what you read on the Internet doesn’t work, scroll down to step three.

Third: Try again, differently.
Yes. I am in fact implying to repeat step two. Keep repeating step two until you find what is the most healing for you. This process is solely a matter of research and discovery. You practice and practice and practice… and practice and practice. All of life is just a breathtaking chance to practice. 

You are learning how to care for your being when it feels like your brain might explode. This is truly challenging work and you’re doing it. Explosive double-high-five to you, my friend. 

I feel deeply grateful for the effort you are investing towards loving and respecting yourself. It’s fucking amazing. You are amazing. Keep that shit up. 

You are worthy of this work and more than anything else in this Universe, you deserve its indescribable benefit.  -->
