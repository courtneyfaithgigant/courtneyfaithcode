		I’ve been struggling recently. I’ve been struggling to release anger and identify why the fuck some people willingly take advantage of nurturing, compassionate humans. Gentle souls, you know where I’m coming from.
	</p>
	<p>
		This manipulative, scummy, abusive behavior does not just affect me. It extends deep into the lives of everyone who inevitability crosses an abuser’s path. So, please, if you find yourself using someone to feel better about yourself. Stop. Take a look at yourself in the mirror and say, “I am better than this.”
	</p>
	<p class="quotes">
		The moment you decide to think, act and live differently, a world of possibilities bow down to you.
	</p>
	<p>
		This epiphany does, however, arrive in three, chronological phases. I’m going to use the names Ashley and George to explain how one moves through these steps. This process is identical for men and women alike (we’re all humans here), I was just feeling kind of script-y— so, choose whichever resonates with you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, if your name is Ashley or George and you are looking for some growth… man did the stars guide you. For everyone else, I am afraid you will not be vicariously featured in this 500-word blog post.

		To start off, Ashley must find herself clearly understanding that her actions are causing Joe, Penelope, Scott, and Piper deep emotional and physical harm. Ashley has to be able to SEE what she is doing and know that it’s abusive.
		</p>
		<p>
		The next phase, phase two, calls for Ashley to accept the repercussions of her actions; Ashley has to own her shit. That’s it. Own it, Ashley.
		</p>
		<p>
		Finally, Ashley has to make the choice to stop depleting others. Once Ashley recognizes that the suffering she causes can be reversed, halted, and cleansed, Ashley can stop hurting herself too. She sees, she accepts, and now she can do something about it. This is how Ashley changes the world - by first changing herself.

		For those of you facing the backlash of someone else’s fear, I am truly sorry. I understand your defaced vulnerability. I know the hurt and desperation these scenarios create. My only cure for these moments is to simply practice forgiveness. You deserve to feel the relief and liberation of letting go. Resentment hurts. Anger hurts. But once the emotional wave has simmered, the lingering pain needs healing.
	</p>
	<p>	
		Although someone else may not deserve your forgiveness, you do. I do. We all deserve to break-free from the chains of small minds and closed hearts.
	</p>

		Besides, what better way to say fuck you than to love yourself anyway?
