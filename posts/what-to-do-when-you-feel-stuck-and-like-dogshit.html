		I don’t know about you but, when I'm in a rut, I just want to sit. I want to not move and I want everyone to not move with me. I get pissy and agitated that the world is hustling when I want to sweatpants my way through the day.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's really just your classic case of: <em>World, why aren’t you validating me?</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		However, being aware of the problem does not always resolve or heal the problem. Believe me. I am always an advocate for shining light onto unresolved dark patches but, that doesn't mean the ickies clear away in an instant.
	</p>
	<p>
		In fact, they often feel much, much worse.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now the cat is out of the bag. We have officially identified that we are feeling stagnant and bleck, <em>what do we do next?</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		It's definitely engrained in our monochronic culture to see a problem and then fix it. We just keep doing that. Over and over and over again. See a problem. Fix it. See a problem. Fix it. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But nowadays, loops always leave me a little skeptical. 
	</p>
	<p>
		What if there is no problem? What if we are just fixing things to have something to do? To keep busy? To distract ourselves from the fact that there is no problem?
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course, sometimes there IS a problem. Peeing yourself in public IS a problem. I've been there. However, I'm just going to say it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not all discomforts are problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		*GASP* 
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Courtney Faith, we live in AMERICA. How dare you?!</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Entire industries and monopolistic empires thrive on our discomforts. They get off on our insecurities and codependency— which they instigated, to no surprise. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You hate your hair because it doesn’t look like this model we spent six days photoshopping? Here’s a water-downed, generic shampoo for $48.99 that will make you FEEL like you’re filling the gaping hole of unconformity that we installed in you as an innocent toddler.
	</p>
	<p>
		I know. I’m just an angsty millennial to likes to complain on the Internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, this statement, <em>Not all discomforts are problems</em>, is really worth considering… Even if it’s just to have a laugh during your reheated, microwavable dinner.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I sit on my embarrassingly stained couch, I’m still baffled by overwhelming feelings of stagnation. I feel schlumpy… like I should be doing more, reading something scholarly, listening to a podcast by someone with an accent. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But I keep typing, noticing. What is coming up? Why is it not okay to just feel stuck?
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps the real question to the topic at hand is: <em>What do we NOT do next?</em>
	</p>
	<p class="">
		We could punish ourselves for not being an all-time American Hustla’.
		</br>
		OR
		</br>
		We could feel the feels.
	</p>
	<p class="">
		We could reach for that cigarette, that Twix bar, that “insert your crutch here.”
		</br>
		OR
		</br>
		We could ask ourselves what is it we are wanting to numb; what are we are really needing?
	</p>
	<p>
		Really what it comes down to— when we are home alone, in the middle of day, drinking our ninth cup of coffee because we are SO bored and SO dissatisfied with where and who we are— is acceptance.
	</p> 
	<p>
		Or lack thereof. 
	</p> 
	<p>
		Sometimes, that’s all there is… bad, yucky feelings that make you want to get Botox and collapse into debt.  
	</p>
	<p>
		These days are not good (which you know full well), but they're definitely not bad. They just don't align with the vision we carry of who and what we WANT to be. However, that doesn't mean you won’t get there. It doesn't mean that it won't manifest for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		What this does mean is that, <em>the present isn't enough</em>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		And, unfortunately, it will remain that way.
	</p>
	<p>
		UNLESS! We decide to accept it. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Accepting our present situation does not mean that we are condoning it. We are not saying, "Welp... This is as good as it gets, Joe. Might as well throw in the rag, take out another loan, and cheat on my wife."
	</p>
	<p>
		Definitely, not.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is saying: I understand that I have no control. I surrender to what is RIGHT NOW. By changing my approach, behavior, and feelings to the present, I am making space to create and embrace what is meant for me. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We are allowing ourselves to accept our helplessness, our stagnation, and all of our lovely discomforts. We simply just let them be as they are.
	</p>
	<p>
		And, you know what happens 100% of the time?
	</p>
	<p>
		INNER WISDOM JEWELS. THAT'S WHAT.
	</p>
	<p>
		God, I fucking love inner wisdom jewels. They take an indescribable amount of pressure and patience to surface but, damn, are they so radiant, so beautiful, and so life-changing. I wouldn’t choose any other path.
	</p>
	<p>
		So today, I will leave you with this question: 
	</p>
	<p>
		In what ways can I, just for this moment, accept that I feel like utter dogshit?
	</p>
	<p>
		This act of acceptance is revolutionary. Not many can do it. Not many want to. But, it’s your life and you’re worth the choice to stop the loop.
