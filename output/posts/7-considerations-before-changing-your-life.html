		Let&apos;s talk about taboos. You and me&mdash; let&apos;s authentically and freely explore the depths of taboos together. I am not talking about the woman who never wears a bra to the office or your sort-of friend who pissed on that nice family&apos;s lawn at 3AM. I want to dive into that dark, terrifying place that we instinctively and habitually regard as nonexistent. <em>Who the fuck likes taboos? Why would you write about something that everyone actively avoids on purpose? Who openly says fuck in published content?</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		I would. Hi, I am Courtney Faith and I&apos;m your pretty standard weirdo. I am here to share, learn, and safely rediscover with you the horrible, scary parts that we all shoved WAY down. As children, we unknowingly began pushing our problems far from the surface to avoid the pain of neglect, hurt, or invalidation. Step two was to then learn a new behavior, a new thought pattern, or a new personality that would deem us worthy of love. In other words, we hid away the real shit and made up some facade we thought other people might like better. Did it work? You tell me.
	</p>
	<p>
		We all want to be unconditionally loved. We all want to be unconditionally accepted. Duh. Here&apos;s the catch. Releasing your current way of life (i.e., your beliefs, your thought loops, your day-to-day routine) is actually really fucking difficult. It takes devotion, resilience, compassion, forgiveness, strength, and an unimaginable amount of courage.
		Worse than your hammered best friend on a Friday, your nastiest taboos demand a lot from you. This process is no 8 week until-you-might-have-some-resemblence-of-a-perfect-ass challenge. It&apos;s about digging up, staring, healing, and legitimately transforming your life. The only difference between uncovering your shit and a diet that makes you special order vegetables for a month is that Option A works long-term&mdash; like, your entire life, long-term.
	</p>
	<p>
		So at this point, you&apos;re either on the <em>how do I start</em> or the <em>that&apos;s, like, too much man</em> bandwagon. And might I say, this is a pivotal pickle you have found yourself in. If your baggage is truly too overwhelming to deal with in this moment, don&apos;t do it. There&apos;s no point in forcing a process you aren&apos;t comfortable with. It will lead you to the same dissatisfying results that brought you here. However, without a single doubt, I can confidently reassure you that your healing time will come and you will know when that hour:minute has arrived. Basically, stop freaking, hug yourself, and keep living your life.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, if you&apos;re already on-board to become the Sherlock Holmes of your internal state, congrats. Get ready for some kickass awakenings. This decision is the greatest gift you can give yourself (yes, it&apos;s even better than front-row Super Bowl tickets). That being said, beginning the path towards a sparkling life of self-love and blissful awesomeness does come with its challenges. So, for those of you who are as Type A as I am, here are some considerations to include on your mental pros and cons list: 
	</p>
	<p>
		<ol>
		
		<li class="post-1-ptitles"><span>It will get worse before it gets better.</span></li>
		Sure. We all want simplicity and ease. Unfortunately, if this were simple and/or easy everyone would be living the life of their dreams already and this blog post would be completely irrelevant.
	</p>
	<p>
		<li class="post-1-ptitles"><span>Your life will change, drastically and unexpectedly.</span></li>
		There will be moments where you wake up and ask how did I even get here? Sometimes &ldquo;here&rdquo; will feel like the swamps of hell; other &ldquo;here&rdquo;s will make you wonder what was ever wrong. In these polar depths, it is really important to recognize that, if your world is changing, you&apos;re doing something right. Even stepping backwards is moving you in a crucial direction towards self-discovery. I mean, how else are you going to know to NEVER date someone like that EVER AGAIN?
	</p>
	<p>
		<li class="post-1-ptitles"><span>Some days will be incredible. Some days will be terrible.</span></li>
		Entering a new way of thinking and living is awkward. You will definitely get it wrong a few times. I definitely ate shit learning how to ride a bike but look at me now! I eat shit a little bit less. And essentially, that&apos;s all of life. Each day we practice reshaping our minds to eat less poop and ride away in freedom.
	</p>
	<p>
		<li class="post-1-ptitles"><span>Growth means saying hello and goodbye.</span></li>
		If you&apos;re in a relationship or environment that promotes a low sense of self-worth, it&apos;s time to say goodbye. If your internal monologue is incessantly reminding you that “you&apos;re never going to be good enough,” it&apos;s time to say goodbye. In contrast, if a new human stumbles into your life that lights up your soul, please say hello. If your subconscious splashes a brilliant insight to the forefront of your brain, again, PLEASE say hello.
	</p>
	<p>
		<li class="post-1-ptitles"><span>Most people will not get it.</span></li>
		I can guarantee you with upmost certainty that someone will really not like what you&apos;re doing. This is the phase where (1) you might lose a few folks, and (2) you may start questioning why you decided to even do this. When this happens (because it will), ask yourself if these people are walking the same path? Do they have the same goals as you do? If not, it&apos;s no sweat. They&apos;re not bad people. In fact, they may be very good people. Their opinions just don&apos;t matter.
	</p>
	<p>
		<li class="post-1-ptitles"><span>You will have to get comfy with every fear you have ever had.</span></li>
		Yup. Every. Single. One. Don&apos;t worry though. You definitely don&apos;t have to face them all at once. You don&apos;t even have to face the entirety of one fear. TBH, if you just start by looking at 1/1000 of a single fear, you will already be closer to that distant dream life you long for. Worth it? Worth it.
	</p>
	<p>
		<li class="post-1-ptitles"><span>Giving up will become deeply attractive.</span></li>
		This work is really hard. You will want to quit. You may even decide one morning to opt-in for growth and then reverse all of it by lunch. Living in the dark is easy and comforting. Squeezing into a mold fed to us is often simpler and more revered than embodying who we really are. However, once you choose to begin your own path, there&apos;s no turning back. You have given yourself permission to embrace your true purpose, and that distant, faded glimmer of hope will always keep your eyes and heart shining forward.
	</p>
		</ol>
	<p>
		First, if you&apos;re reading this, I applaud you for wanting to choose yourself. It really is fucking difficult and you are actually doing it. I believe that this article finds exactly who needs it, at the perfect time, in the most perfect way. So, again, thank you. You&apos;re doing us all a big favor by lovin&apos; all over yourself.
	</p>
	<p> 
		Second, if this is all foreign garbage to you, that&apos;s totally fine too. I don&apos;t even care if you sat there and spat at your screen for 10 minutes. I just really hope that something sparked a flame within you to be you today, and tomorrow, and for the rest of your incredibly short life&mdash; even if that means you&apos;re a screen-spitter.
