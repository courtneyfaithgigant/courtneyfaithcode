		Love is all you need. Yes… but also, shelter, food, clothing and a community that supports and accepts you. As living, breathing humans, we have some basic necessities. We have needs. Okay, I’ll just say it, we are all inherently, pretty damn needy. We need each other. The world needs every life within it to survive, let alone operate.
	</p>
	<p>
		Which leads me to my first question: who officially labeled “neediness” as a red flag? Seriously, show me some credentials. If there’s a dooming cloud of societal shame punishing you for something you have no control over, how the hell are you supposed to feel good about yourself, ever? 
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course, there are <a href= "http://www.courtneyfaith.com/posts/how-to-set-boundaries-101.html">degrees of attachment</a> ranging from fulfilling to toxic but this fundamental part of your make-up is always present. Connection is not an optional life plug-in; it’s hardwired into the mainframe, baby.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href=”https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/health/lonliness-aging-health-effects.html?_r=0”>Countless studies</a> have revealed that isolation causes death. Oh yeah, the scariest and most suppressed word of them all—death. Without intimacy and openness, without exposing the intricacies of the inner self, we die. Straight up. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This is why we cling to our phones. How else are we supposed to receive that healing, validating energy that only relationships can foster? As a society we have been conditioned to fear intimate, in-person engagement; we continue to demean our basic urge for connection.  Vulnerability equates to weakness, which equates to failure. And god forbid we disappoint gran-pappy… again. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As a blooming twenty-first century adult, how does one begin to cultivate a healthy, meaningful relationship?

		<div class="body"></p>
		Before you even consider embarking on this quest for genuine connection, get to know yourself. What do YOU want? What do YOU need? Not every person is going to bring the same ingredients to the table. This is the time where you decide what is important to your recipe—aka, life—and serve yourself. It is when we don’t outline our values that we slip into deeply harmful partnerships. We become co-dependent because anything or anyone will do. We are replacing the internal void with another life until our void swallows them too. <a href="http://www.courtneyfaith.com/posts/top-23-songs-to-reclaim-your-day.html">Reclaiming your self-esteem</a> and cultivating self-awareness are both pertinent before launching yourself into the daunting but rewarding land of relationships.

		<div class="body">
		Chances are, you won’t find the resonate-at-a-core-level connections the first go around. Stick with it. The more often you expose yourself to new environments and take in what it has to offer, the greater your opportunity to discover your people. On my own path, this has always been the hardest part. But I can say from experience, your tribe is out there. I promise.

		<div class="body">
		If you already have a crew but express workaholic tendencies, rearrange your schedule. Tap open your Google calendar and move some shit around. Allot 15 to 30 minutes a day to just reaching out to someone. Strengthening existing relationships is far less work than finding new friends. Also, just as a bonus, it nurtures compassion and expedites trust.

		<div class="body">
		We have all been there. You’re trying to tell someone a story and their eyes slowly drift away onto the screen in their lap. You feel devalued and unimportant—which, to me, is completely valid. Attention relays that you are concerned and care-for another person’s well-being. So, if you’re meeting with someone for an hour… just put it away. By minimizing the physical distractions, you are setting yourself up for a meaningful connection without having to say anything. And for those of you who sometimes run out of shit to say, this is game changer. 
		</div></li>
	
	<p class="post-1-ptitles">Open Your Ears.</p>
		<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/dChHIWFsVvfuE" width="480" height="269.76" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
		<div class="body">
		This means listening. It’s really a no brainer. The only difficult part about listening is that it requires care. You have to genuinely care about the person behind the words. It doesn’t mean you’d donate them a kidney. It doesn’t mean both of your families take a Disney cruise together. It simply means valuing what they have to say over your mind’s running list of alternate activities. 
		</div></li>
	
	<p class="post-1-ptitles">Allow Someone Else the Space To Be Where They Are.</p>

		<div class="body">
		I often find myself longing to stop the suffering of others. Because I can immediately know how someone is feeling, it quickly becomes horribly difficult to simply sit with their pain as well as my own. The solution? Try to change them? No. That shit definitely doesn’t work. <a href="http://www.courtneyfaith.com/posts/how-to-change-manipulative-patterns-and-forgive-abusers.html">We resort to manipulation</a> because we have the power to influence emotions; however, everyone who is entangled in this exchange ends up deeply wounded as a result. Refusing to acknowledge and accept the pain of the present moment only intensifies suffering and rainchecks the problem. So, if you’re like me and NEED TO HELP, consider the greatest support you can provide as the gift of holding space for someone to just feel and be as they are. 
		</div></li>
	
	<p class="post-1-ptitles">Above All Else, Love Yourself.</p>
		<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/pDEL91v6msbQY" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
		<div class="body">
		Self-love unlocks the door to the longest, most healing relationship of your existence, the relationship with yourself. As your self-love journey evolves, your standards reset, your beliefs shift and your own perceived worth slowly redefines. And, although it may not be easy or simple, it is the only route to true openness and connection.
		</div></li>
	
	<p>
		Sometimes, when you’re trying to connect with someone, they’re just having a shit day. Sometimes you’re having a shit day. Sometimes we feel unstoppable. Sometimes we feel utterly defeated. This is the nature of relationships. Really though, this is the nature of life. It is purely a beautiful, chaotic mix of learning from suffering and celebrating in love.
	</p>
	<p> 
		That being said, we cannot overcome our fear of authentic connection by rejecting our need for others. We begin to heal that gaping hole by first noticing that it’s there. Then we can begin peeling back the layers of hurt that have scarred our lives and closed our hearts. The opportunity for connection is everywhere. Fulfillment is your birthright.
