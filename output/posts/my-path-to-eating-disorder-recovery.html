<div class="content">
	<p>
		Today, to extend my gratitude to every beautiful and indescribably brave soul battling an eating disorder, I will share a glimmer of my recovery journey. My story will not include names or locations, nor will it involve blame of any shape— because frankly, it has nothing to do with anyone or anything other than myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yes, my environment and social communities deeply influenced how I learned to cope with pain, rejection, fear, and hurt. However, instead of creating the eating disorder, these external factors only woke what was dormant within. Like alcoholism, Alzheimer&apos;s, or breast cancer, an eating disorder is genetic and flows through your familial line. This means that some people are more susceptible to collapsing into the mental, emotional, and physical agony of an eating disorder when placed and pressured in a climate ripe with triggers.
	</p>
	<p class="bolder">
		I want to pause here and affirm that there&apos;s nothing wrong with this inevitable fact. No one gets to choose their circumstance, so no one is to blame. Everything just arrives, unfolds, and turns to dust as it&apos;s meant to.
	</p>
	<p>
		I cannot remember how it began. In most recollections, it feels as though my entire life path consisted of shoving away fear. Food was my comfort. Food was my safety. Food was always there to protect; it never left me. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As a child, you don&apos;t have the conscious awareness to recognize that you&apos;re reaching for food to fuel your body&apos;s need to suppress. However, when a ten year old puts away a gallon of ice cream at 2AM, something is wrong.
	</p>
	<p>
		Facing condemnation for my physical appearance was a later but unavoidable backlash. My eating disorder grew exponentially from junior high, to high school, to college. In each season of my life, I was only able to control so much. The more difficult life became and the more isolation I sought, the worse my eating disorder developed. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As I stepped from childhood to young-adulthood, I simultaneously crossed the threshold of binging to bulimia. The incessant, gnawing vacancy of &ldquo;never being enough&rdquo; continued to dictate every thought, action, and choice. Entire granola bar boxes, Oreo packages, and cookie dough sticks were swallowed in a sitting and then purged in an hour.
	</p>
	<p class="quotes">
		&ldquo;The laughter, affection, and hope that mildly picked at the surface, was now entirely terminated. My only aspiration was to be granted the serenity of eluding light and immersing demise. Each day prolonged my comatose; I ceased to feel, anything. The incessant desire to attain comfort by tasting meals twice reappeared commensurately with the fresh incisions etched in my skin. Would I ever be liberated from my tortuous chains? Could I clamber out of the well that drowned my dreams and exterminated my very essence?&rdquo;*
	</p>
	<p>
		I was losing my life by resisting who I was.
	</p>
	<p>
		Towards the end of high school, I had been teetering from bulimia, to anorexia, to hoping that someone would save me. In those indescribable depths of suffering, my only life source was dancing. I could rely on and cling to the security of movement. I truly believed that, in order to maintain my one lifeline, I needed to starve myself.
	</p>
	<p class="quotes">
		&ldquo;As I regrettably stood in the depleting flood of vomit swamping my ankles, only the residue of counterfeit relief remained. I wholeheartedly believed that to cease eating would save me from myself… Inching from dim to dark to black, my body diminished. How secure was an asylum, if it was fashioned on a food fearing foundation? My will to persevere embraced my daily nutrients; together, they stole away into porcelain pipes.&rdquo; *
	</p>
	<p>
		College came quickly and so did the countless relapses. I was scared and hopeless. I lived a waking nightmare, every day. Years went by where I shifted between stealing food from my roommates to consuming 600 calories a day. Punishing myself for eating a packet of honey is a life over <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/get-facts-eating-disorders">30 million Americans live daily</a>.** This is not a brag. This is a terrified scream for help.
	</p>
	<p>
		From the ages of 16 to 20, the number of suicide letters I had written exceeded the number of times I whispered <em>I love you Courtney.</em> I was fading. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Until one, otherwise insignificant afternoon, I phoned my closest friend. It was so simple. All I expressed was that I needed help, and all she shared was that I had her by my side. That was it. This exchange of transparent authenticity and unconditional support revolutionized my life and kickstarted my path to recovery.
	</p>
	<p class="bolder">
		Every single breath from that moment on was a commitment to myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		I still relapsed, I still hurt myself, and I still desperately longed for death. This process was and remains incredibly difficult. I had to release friendships and family, I had to let go of loves and hurts, and <a href="http://courtneyfaith.com/posts/top-23-songs-to-reclaim-your-day.html">I had to choose myself every single morning</a>. However, with the lapsing of time, I also grew in strength and courage. I had initiated a quiet rediscovery of my true, authentic self.
	</p>
	<p>
		Eventually, this commitment produced life-changing help, inspiring friendships, and faith in my capacity to heal. I took so many fucking baby steps I thought I was reverting back into one. But today, I am here and I am free. My eating disorder no longer decides the quality or direction of my life. 
	</p>
	<p class="bolder">
		The gratitude I feel for the child who persevered through this nightmare is unparalleled. Because she never gave up on herself, I can now exist in more love than I ever conceived possible. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As I round out my story, I want to make it incredibly clear that I am a human, just like you. My path was and is absolutely extraordinary but I am not an exception. Every day, there are so many fearless women stripping away their eating disorders and facing the underlying truth of what drove their ED. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Freedom is possible and so is a life without your eating disorder. My hope for you as you finish reading is that: (1) you know that you are always supported, (2) you step into this fight knowing you are the predetermined winner, and (3) you understand that at the core of your being is a love that can heal all things. 
	</p>

		*At 18 years old, I responded to the college essay question: describe a difficult circumstance you have faced and how you recovered. I still cry at the strength and courage my younger self embodied. I survived the torment of my mind and the decaying of my body. I preserved and I won.
