	<p>
		When I allow other people's emotional states to seep through my skin, my entire energy field rattles. I notice I am no longer myself but assuming the emotions of others. I know it boils down to my empathic nature but this experience is nothing profound. We all do it at a very fundamental level. If the feeling tone of a room is stressed and anxious, your own sympathetic nervous system is more likely to define this situation as one of "high-alert"- meaning, it will be more difficult to find grounding and peace in this space.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is not uncommon for our energy to be invaded by those who we perceive as an authority figure. As we give away our power, we allow another human to determine how it is handled. We give them the permission to manipulate or create with our energy. Thus, we give them the space and authority to heal or hurt us.
	</p>
	<p class="quotes">
		The opportunity for this exchange occurs in every moment. It is an ebb and flow, a give and take, a surrender and receive.
	</p>
	<p>
		When coaches, teachers, or family members discuss boundaries, THIS is what they are referring to. This is a natural coping mechanism to protect our energy and honor our state of being.
	</p>
	<p class="dot">
		Here are the three situations where these boundaries can be implemented:
	</p>
	
		<ol>
		
		<li class="post-1-ptitles"><span>When communicating and sharing yourself with other humans.</span>
		<div class="body">
		If you find yourself in a scenario where someone is sucking your energy and leaving you vacant or empty, fire-up a boundary. Interrupt. Leave. Set time limits. Refuse to meet with them. Do what you must to care for YOUR energy. No one has ownership or privilege over your energy. It is yours. People may get upset that you're taking back your energy, but that's okay. They will just have to accept that they are not entitled to your energy and that they must move on to another victim.
		</div></li>
	
		<li class="post-1-ptitles"><span>When entering a new or toxic environment.</span>
		<div class="body">
		People will try to take advantage of you; not everyone, but most. When ripe with insecurity, the easiest way for an individual to satiate his or her toxic fear is to steal power from others. It's hard to believe an optimist could throw down statements like those. However, the truth always rests in the heart of darkness. Now, if you find yourself feeling full of resentment, first ask yourself where in your body you are feeling this hurt. Second, when you locate the pain, directly ask that space what it's missing or needing. Third, just listen. Our pain is never about the "who" or "where." Although understanding its root is essential to appropriately direct our feelings, it ultimately doesn't matter what triggered or created the suffering. <a href="http://courtneyfaith.com/posts/7-considerations-before-changing-your-life.html">You are now the life responsible for healing</a>. Yes, it is fucked up. Yes, it is cruel and twisted. But, it is in these moments of choosing to stop, reflect and change- despite our circumstance- that we reclaim our lives. We become our own soul warriors. 
		</div></li>
	
		<li class="post-1-ptitles"><span>When comparing or degrading yourself.</span>
		<div class="body">
		Nothing misaligns my energy more than when my mind assumes judgement. <em>That's ugly. You're fat. He's stupid. This is dumb. You don't have enough. You could do better. The world is horrible. People are fucked. Life is disgusting.</em> Did I cover them all? Boundaries are the most pivotal when addressing yourself. If you notice your mind slipping and your heart waning, <a href="http://courtneyfaith.com/posts/top-23-songs-to-reclaim-your-day.html">cease the voices</a>. Give yourself the space to be where you are in this moment. The boundary is to say no more. It is choosing to trust the uncertainty. It is choosing to allow the pain, guilt or boredom to be held within you with unconditional love, despite it all. 
		</div></li>
	
		</ol>
	<p class="dot">
		Important! Walls are not synonymous to boundaries. They are fundamentally grounded in two opposing motives. We build walls out of fear and we establish boundaries out of love.
	</p>
	<p>	
		Boundaries allow us to say yes with trust and no without shame.
	</p>
	<p class="quotes">
		Today, you have the power and the right to learn your boundaries and to protect your inner-child. And once you have seen, held and nurtured this past, you are free to choose your future.
